# Mini PHP Project

Welcome to the Mini PHP Project! This website aims to provide a robust authentication system with both public and private sections accessible through a login page. Users can have one or multiple roles assigned to them.

## Features

- **Authentication System**: The website includes a secure login page that allows users to access the private section based on their assigned roles.
- **Administration Dashboard**: An administration dashboard is available for managing the website's settings and user roles.
- **Contact Us**: Users can easily contact the website through email for any inquiries or support.
- **Testing Functionalities**: Such as PDF generation and process flows (e.g., purchase journey for an e-commerce site).

## Getting Started

To get started with the Mini PHP Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine, preferably in ("C:\xampp\htdocs") so that PHP works
2. Set up a local development environment with PHP and a web server (e.g., XAMPP).
3. Run the website and explore its features.

## To make Changes

1. Cloning the Repository:
    Each collaborator needs to clone the repository to their local machine using Git. They can do this by running the command `git clone <repository_url>` in their terminal.

2. Making Changes and Pushing:
    Collaborators can make changes to the code, create new files, or modify existing ones within the cloned repository on their local machine.
    After making changes, they need to commit those changes using Git and then push them to the remote repository on GitHub using `git push`.

3. Pulling Changes:
    If one collaborator *pushes changes to the repository*, others need to **pull those changes** to their local repository **before** *making their own changes* to ensure they're working with the latest version. They can do this using `git pull`.
